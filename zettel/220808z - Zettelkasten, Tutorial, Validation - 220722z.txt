Zettelkasten, Tutorial, Validation
8.8.22
220727z

The last subcommand is `zet validation`. It will show you inconsistencies in your zettelkasten like:
* Double ids (ids should be unique)
* Dead links to predecessor zettel (links should always point to an existing zettel/id)
* Literature entry is not present in literature.bib
* Not able to parse a filename

Try `zet validation` in your console within the zettelkasten directory. You see that there is a missing link. Instead of `220601e`, you probably meant `220601z`. Change it and run `zet validate` again. The inconsistency is now gone.

Press `zet help` to see all available commands.
