Note that this filename has an id at the end ("220527z"). This id is a link and means that when you wrote this zettel, you also thought of that previous zettel 220527z.

Of course, it would be convenient not to manually jump around in the folder `zettel/` between linked zettel. Type `zet views` in your console within your folder `zettelkasten/`. You now have an automatically generated folder `VIEWS/`, that contains an index folder. Here you can see an ordered line of thought through your zettel.

`zet` generates the Index using the `index.txt`. Here you define thematic entry points in your zettelkasten. Look at the `index.txt`. Here you see an entry `zettelkasten: 220527z`. This entry means that to enter your line of thoughts about the topic "zettelkasten", you should start with the zettel with id 220527z.

Now go to the next zettel in this line of thought about the topic "zettelkasten" by navigating into `zettelkasten/VIEWS/index/zettelkasten`.
