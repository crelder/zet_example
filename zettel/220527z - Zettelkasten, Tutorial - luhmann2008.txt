Zettelkasten, Tutorial
27.5.22, luhmann2008

You have now a small example zettelkasten. It has a simple structure. A folder (e.g. `zettelkasten`) holds everything you need for your personal knowledge management. It has three elements:

* a folder `zettel/` with zettel (= images or text files with the content of your thoughts - everything were you had *some considerable amount of own thought involved*, the result of thinking while reading a book, talking/arguing to someone about a topic, etc., see luhmann2008)
* a `literature.bib` with information on literature sources
* an `index.txt` file (contains entry points into lines of thought about a particular topic)
* a folder with own works (these are the results of combining thoughts - during the process of writing a final work, also knowledge gets created)

This solves three problems:

1. You want to find a thought that you know to exist in your knowledge management system
2. You want to find relevant thoughts around a particular topic that you don't know to exist in your knowledge
   management system
3. You want a tool that supports in developing lines of thoughts and train your ability to think in a structured manner

Now look at the zettel 1222222 in your folder zettelkasten/zettel.
