Now you wrote some new zettel. If you wrote them as text, then you can use `zet import PATH` to import all zettel as textfiles within a folder.

Look into `zettelkasten/zettel/new`. Here you see two textfiles with a random name (the name doesn't matter, since it will get overwritten).

Now within folder `zettelkasten` in your shell, type `zet import new`.

You now have to new zettel in your zettelkasten:

* xxxxxx
* sdfdfsf

The command takes the header of the text zettel and generates the correct filename from it.

When you have zettel on paper, you have to extract the filename and write it manually.

Use your folder zettelkasten/VIEWS/zettelkasten to look at the next zettel in this line of thought (the tutorial) - it is 220611z.
