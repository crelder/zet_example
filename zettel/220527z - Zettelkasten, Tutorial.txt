Zettelkasten, Tutorial
27.5.22

You now have an example zettelkasten, see `zettelkasten/`.

It has a simple structure: this folder contains everything you need for your personal knowledge management system. It has four elements:

* a folder `zettel/` with "zettel". A "zettel" is an image or text file with the content of your thoughts, meaning something where you had *some considerable amount of own thought involved*: the result of thinking while reading a book, talking/arguing to someone about a topic, etc.
* a `literature.bib` with information on literature sources (e.g., books, papers, etc.).
* an `index.txt` file. This file contains entry points into lines of thought about a particular topic.
* a folder with own works. This folder is like the folder `zettel/` but contains final works like own thesis chapter, own book chapters, own presentations, etc.

To learn how to visualize lines of thought, open the zettel with id 220529s in your folder `zettelkasten/zettel`.
