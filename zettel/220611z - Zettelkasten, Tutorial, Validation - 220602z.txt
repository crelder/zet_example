The last subcommand of `zet` is `zet validation`.o

Navigate in your shell into `zettelkasten` an run `zet validate`. You now will see several problems.

It will show you inconsistencies in your zettelkasten like:
* Double ids (ids should be unique)
* Dead linke (links should always point to an existing zettel/id)
* Literature entry is not present in literature.bib

Rename the id xy to uu, so that it unique. 

Run `zet validate` again. Now you see that this problem is gone.

There is a dead link xxxx. Remove that link of find the zettel it pointed to.

Enter a literature entry in your bibtex file.
