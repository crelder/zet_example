Above is a real zettel out of my zettelkasten. You can define literature resources in the filename via "AuthorYear" and optionally add a page after a space, see kernighan1999 117. Adding this information is not only helpful for working with references with scientific standards.

This zettel doesn't have a follow-up zettel (Folgezettel) yet. Go back to the line of thoughts of `zettelkasten/VIEWS/index/zettelkasten`.
